# WIP Reproducible example of 'hanging' pgf recipes with CMIP6 data

In this repo I am working towards creating a minimal reproducible example of 'hanging' pgf recipes - meaning recipes that do not error out, but seemingly idle around for many hours (even days). My hope is that this can help inform a fix for https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-recipes/issues/710 and ultimately avoid a need for my [CMIP6 zombie job killer](https://github.com/leap-stc/cmip6-leap-feedstock/blob/main/.github/workflows/ash.yaml)(which indiscriminately kills jobs after a certain runtime to avoid cost overrun).
